Challenge for Lambda

## Getting started

This is a very simple static webpage that can be accessed by just clicking on this link:

If you want to download it and run it on your computer, download the zip file, extract its contents and then open the file "index.html" in the browser.

The file "test.js" has some unitary tests that can run on Node. If you don't have Node installed, you can get it from the official [Node website](https://nodejs.org/es/). Once you Node on your computer, the file "test.js" runs with the command `node test.js`.
